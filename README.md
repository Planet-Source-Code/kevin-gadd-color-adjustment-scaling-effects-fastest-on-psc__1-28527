### Description

Demonstrates performing dozens of graphical effects using the high-speed Fury2 Graphics Engine.
 
### More Info
 
Graphics data, and a few different parameters.

Fury2GE is designed similarly to GDI and DirectDraw, but without as many quirks. The C++ (F2SoftFX.dll) is still in beta, so you may get an occasional crash.

Altered graphics data

Saving lots of time by not having to write your own graphics code.
